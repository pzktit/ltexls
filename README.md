# LTeX LS Dockerfile 

A Dockerfile for building [LTeX LS](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls) image. It can be used for building development containers for VS Code
that use [LTeX](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/) extension. That way there is no need for downloading LTeX LS system for every new container.
